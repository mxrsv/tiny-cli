# Cleaning caches

`tiny clean` finds caches and leftovers you can remove, shows how much space each category
takes, lets you pick, and asks what to do before touching anything. It needs macOS. The
[desktop app](desktop.md) offers the Move to Trash part of it.

```bash
tiny clean                              # picker → plan → action menu
tiny clean --dry-run                    # show the plan and exit
tiny clean --include-review             # also list categories worth a look first
tiny clean --include-destructive        # also list the permanent ones
tiny clean --review-paths               # untick individual paths before acting
tiny clean --category node-modules      # only this category (repeatable)
tiny clean --category trash --hard      # Hard delete preselected: empties the Trash
```

Run `--dry-run` first on a new machine.

## Categories

33 categories in three families. Each has a risk level that decides whether you see it by
default.

**Dev caches** — `cargo`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `node-modules`, `python-caches`,
`rust-targets`, `gradle-maven`, `jetbrains`, `vscode`, `ios-simulators`, `simulator-devices`,
`android-sdk`, `go-cache`, `docker`, `docker-volumes`, `xcode-derived`, `xcode-archives`,
`xcode-devicesupport`.

**User storage** — `downloads-old`, `screenshots-old`, `mail-attachments`,
`streaming-caches`, `chat-caches`, `browser-caches`.

**System leftovers** — `user-logs`, `user-caches`, `trash`, `quarantine`, `crash-reports`,
`app-orphans`, `time-machine-local`, `font-quicklook-caches`.

| Risk        | Shown                        | Categories                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe        | always, already ticked       | `user-logs`, `crash-reports`, `font-quicklook-caches`, `xcode-derived` |
| Review      | with `--include-review`      | everything else                                                        |
| Destructive | with `--include-destructive` | `trash`, `time-machine-local`, `docker-volumes`, `simulator-devices`   |

Naming a category with `--category` shows it whatever its risk; the `--include-*` flags are
then ignored.

## Choosing what to clean

1. **Pick categories.** Grouped by family, with Safe ones already ticked; Space toggles,
   Enter confirms.
2. **Read the plan.** The paths that would be removed, with sizes.
3. **Choose an action:**
   - **Move to Trash (recoverable)** — the default.
   - **Dry-run (no changes)** — stop here.
   - **Review paths (drill-down)** — untick individual paths, then come back to this menu.
   - **Hard delete (NOT recoverable)** — asks you to confirm once more.
   - **Cancel**.

At the end tiny prints how many paths it removed and lists any it could not.

## What is found

- `--idle-days N` (default 30, must be above 0) — `node-modules`, `rust-targets` and the
  virtualenvs in `python-caches` are listed only for projects with no manifest edit, commit
  or uncommitted change in `N` days. `downloads-old` lists files directly in `~/Downloads`
  neither modified nor opened for `N` days, `screenshots-old` lists screenshots not modified
  for `N` days, and `android-sdk` uses it for emulator system images.
- Project caches are searched under `~/Documents`, `~/Projects`, `~/Code`, `~/Developer` and
  `~/Workspace`.
- Some categories are skipped while their app is open, and tiny tells you which app to quit:
  the Xcode categories (Xcode), `ios-simulators` and `simulator-devices` (Xcode or
  Simulator), `mail-attachments` (Mail), `vscode` (VS Code), `android-sdk` (Android Studio),
  `docker` and `docker-volumes` (Docker Desktop).
- `browser-caches`, `chat-caches`, `streaming-caches` and `user-caches` instead leave out
  just the folders of apps that are running, without a message. Quit the app and run again
  to see them.

## Your own files

`downloads-old`, `screenshots-old` and `mail-attachments` hold files nothing recreates; once
removed, only the Trash brings them back. Selecting one of these categories selects every
file it lists, including ones that look private such as keys or recovery codes. Read the
plan, and untick what you want to keep with `--review-paths`. The desktop app flags
private-looking downloads and never ticks them for you.

## Safety

- **Move to Trash is the default.** It goes through Finder, so Put Back works.
- **Hard delete is permanent** and asks you to confirm. `--hard` only preselects it in the
  menu. With `-y` there is no prompt, so tiny also requires `TINY_CONFIRM_HARD=1`:
  `TINY_CONFIRM_HARD=1 tiny clean --category cargo --hard -y`.
- **`-y` needs `--category`**, so an unattended run always names its scope.
- **The Trash can only be emptied**, with Hard delete. With `trash` selected, Move to Trash
  is refused and nothing is changed.
- **Some cleanup has no Trash.** `docker` prunes unused images and build cache;
  `docker-volumes` prunes unused volumes, which hold container data such as databases;
  `time-machine-local` deletes local snapshots; `simulator-devices` deletes simulators that
  Xcode reports unavailable. These are permanent whichever action you choose, and tiny warns
  you when you pick Move to Trash.
- **`app-orphans` is report only.** It lists Application Support folders that match no
  installed app, but a folder name does not prove the app is gone, so tiny never moves
  them. Check them in Finder.
- **Symlinks are never followed**, so nothing outside the listed paths can be removed.

> Move to Trash is still deletion if macOS empties the Trash automatically
> (System Settings → General → Storage). Turn that off or use `--dry-run` first.
